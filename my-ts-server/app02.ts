// Functions and Scope

/*  * - Create examples of basic functions that represent different
 *   possibilities of the language:
 *   Without parameters or return value, with one or more parameters, with return value...
 * - Check if you can create functions within functions.
 * - Use some examples of functions already available in the language.
 * - Test the concept of LOCAL and GLOBAL variables.
 * - You must print the result of all the examples to the console.
 *   (and keep in mind that each language may have more or fewer possibilities)
 *
 * EXTRA DIFFICULTY (optional):
 * Create a function that receives two string parameters and returns a number.
 * - The function prints all numbers from 1 to 100, considering that:
 *   - If the number is a multiple of 3, it shows the string from the first parameter.
 *   - If the number is a multiple of 5, it shows the string from the second parameter.
 *   - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it shows the two strings concatenated.
 *   - The function returns the number of times the number itself was printed instead of the texts.
